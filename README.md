# ObjJava
 One more UNI course work repository, this time it's JAVA time. During this course I will be coding a vectorial graphics applet fully in java.


Compiling when in /editor/ folder
```sh
javac -d bin src/shapes/*/*.java src/test/Test.java
```
Running from /editor/ folder
```sh
 java -cp bin test.Test
```
